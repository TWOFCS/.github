The TWOFCS community is an international collection of researchers who are 
interested in understanding the dynamics of the nuclear fuel cycle, as it 
responds over time to different technology options, policy frameworks, and 
socioeconomic drivers.

The name, TWOFCS, is derived from the annual workshop series on this topic,
the Technical Workshop on Fuel Cycle Simulation, that brings together the
community for deep discussion of nuclear fuel cycle modeling tools and 
capabilities, specific national and international fuel cycle scenarios, and 
interactions of these tools and scenarios with broader socioeconomics of 
the energy system.  The [most recent workshop, TWOFCS2025, was held June 11-13, 2025, 
in Chicago, IL, USA](https://github.com/TWOFCS/TWOFCS-2025).

Repositories in this organization are imagined for the following purposes:
* materials from individual TWOFCS workshops
* database of fuel cycle scenario specifications
* database for fundamental inputs to fuel cycle simulations including
  (but not limited to):
    * costs
    * transmutation data
    * individual facility configurations
